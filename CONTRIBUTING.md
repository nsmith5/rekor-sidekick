# Contributing to Rekor Sidekick

So you're thinking of contributing of Rekor Sidekick? That is fantastic! Here
are are the basic guidelines.

## Before starting

Whether its a bug or a new feature, almost all changes should start with filing
an issue to discuss. Agreeing on if something should change and how to change
it ahead of time is great way to not waste your time or maintainer time.

If you see an issue you want to work on or you've filed one yourself, fork the
repository and start hacking away

## While you're working

For every commit to Rekor Sidekick we strive to have the following be true:

- Each commit is signed off (using the
  [DCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)). You
can ensure this is the case by adding the `-s` flag when you commit code.
- All tests are passing (ensure this locally _before_ pushing code with `go test ./...`)

## Finishing up

Once you're happy with your work, open a pull request. We try to review each PR
in a timely manner. Assume best intent in this process. _Just because you've
completed work does not entitle you have that work merged upstream_.
